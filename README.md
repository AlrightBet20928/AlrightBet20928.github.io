### 360

Project Description
My project is called the "Weed Patch Project". In the middle of my school, we have a weed patch that is enclosed by buildings. It is an eyesore and is never really even used. Our EAST program wanted to take advantage of this space to use as an outdoor classroom and greenhouse. We are going to let teachers use the outdoor classroom to learn outside of the classroom and to see nature. Our biology classes will maintain a greenhouse as well to study how plants are grown. We will use the produce grown in the greenhouse in our cafeteria for fresher fruits and vegetables. We plan to make the weedpatch look better by adding a concrete slab for the outdoor classroom, planting flowers in the greenhouse, and possibly having the art department create a mural on the walls surrounding it. I chose to take a 360 picture of the space now so that our students working on the project are able to create a 3D model of the patch based on this 360 picture. I hope that this allows the students to even put their modeled objects into the picture so that they can see how it would be in real life. This will also allow the students to see where any piping, drains, or objects in the ground are so they will not build over them. Although the stitching is not perfect, I took pictures from two different angles to make up for it. I would like to add pictures of the finished weed patch project, but we cannot start building in the weed patch until school is out.
